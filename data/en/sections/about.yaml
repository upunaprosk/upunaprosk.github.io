# your company information


# a summary about you
summary: "I am a PhD student at the ERIC Lab, a research unit affiliated with the University of Lyon and Lyon 2, under the supervision of **Prof. Julien Velcin** and **Assoc. Prof. Guillaume Metzler**. 
My research focuses on estimating and predicting the **behavior of compressed language models**, with particular attention to **biased outcomes resulting from compression**. 
Additionally, I am working on developing new French benchmarks that could help mitigate these biases.
\n  
The website of the ANR project, which my PhD is part of, is accessible [here](https://www.anr-dike.fr/).
\n\n
Prior to my PhD, I obtained my MSc from the Higher School of Economics University (HSE) and completed the second year of my master's in the picturesque city of Clermont-Ferrand, located in the central part of France, as part of a double degree program.
During my master studies, I worked as a research intern at the Learner Corpora Lab (HSE), where I collaborated with a team of corpus and computational linguists on grammatical error detection in learner-written essays and worked with the JetBrains team to enhance the Grazie tool.
I also worked at the Laboratory for Models and Methods of Computational Pragmatics at HSE on the application of topological data analysis to grammatical acceptability judgments.\n\n
