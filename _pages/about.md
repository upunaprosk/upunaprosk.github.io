I am a PhD student in the ERIC Lab, part of the University of Lyon and Lyon 2, under the supervision of [Prof. Julien Velcin](https://velcin.github.io) and [Prof. Guillaume Metzler](https://guillaumemetzler.github.io). My research focuses on understanding and predicting how compression affects language models, especially regarding biased outcomes. I am also working on new French benchmarks to address these biases.

My PhD is funded by the French National Research Agency ANR and is part of the [DIKE (DICE) project](https://www.anr-dike.fr).

Before starting my PhD, I earned an MSc in Computer Science through a double degree program between the Higher School of Economics (HSE University) and the University of Clermont-Ferrand. During this time, I interned at the Learner Corpora Lab, part of HSE University, where I collaborated with corpus and computational linguists on grammatical error detection in learner essays and contributed to improving the Grazie tool in partnership with JetBrains. Later, I worked at the Laboratory for Models and Methods of Computational Pragmatics, also part of HSE University, where I explored topological data analysis for acceptability judgments.
