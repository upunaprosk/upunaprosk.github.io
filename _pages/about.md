I am a PhD student at the ERIC Lab (University of Lyon and Lyon 2), supervised by [Prof. Julien Velcin](https://velcin.github.io) and [Prof. Guillaume Metzler](https://guillaumemetzler.github.io). My research focuses on estimating and predicting the behavior of compressed language models, with particular attention to biased outcomes resulting from compression.
I am also developing new French benchmarks aimed at mitigating these biases. 

My PhD is supported by the French National Research Agency (ANR) and is part of [the DIKE (DICE) project]( https://www.anr-dike.fr).

Before pursuing my PhD, I obtained an MSc in Computer Science through a double degree program at the Higher School of Economics (HSE) and the University of Clermont-Ferrand. 
During my masterâ€™s studies, I worked as a research intern at the Learner Corpora Lab (HSE), where I collaborated with a team of corpus and computational linguists on grammatical error detection in learner-written essays and contributed to enhancing the Grazie tool in partnership with the JetBrains team. 
Additionally, I worked as a research intern at the Laboratory for Models and Methods of Computational Pragmatics (HSE), applying topological data analysis to grammatical acceptability judgments.
